It’s the time to move to next level in my web development career, after learning HTML/CSS and JS. Now it’s the of WordPress. Chalenge is that 30 Days everyday I learn something and I write about it. from scratch to mastring WordPress theme development. it’s first day, let’s start by what I learned.


### 1. Setup a Local WordPress Development Environment.
NB: I use debian linux distribution operating system, if using **windows** or other Linux Destribution, serch how to setup your local development environment. on **Google**.

let's go :) 
#### Step 1 — Installing Apache 


{% highlight terminal %}
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install apache2

{% endhighlight %}

#### Step 2 —  Installing Mysql

{% highlight terminal %}
$ sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common mysql-server-core-* mysql-client-core-*

{% endhighlight %}

#### Step 3 —  Installing PHP

{% highlight terminal %}
$ sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
{% endhighlight%}



Now you can test whether your web server is able to correctly display content generated by this PHP script. To try this out, visit this page in your web browser. You'll need your server's public IP address again.

The address you will want to visit is:

{% highlight text %}
http://127.0.0.1/info.php
{% endhighlight%}

#### Step 4 —  Installing WordPress
Go to WordPress Downloads [page](https://wordpress.org/download/), and download WordPress.
Extrat Downloaded .zip file  in ```/var/www/html``` folder and go to ```http://127.0.0.1/wordpress``` and Start installing.

Oh I forgot you should create a database first, by executing these commands on Terminal:
{% highlight terminal %}
$ mysql -u root -p
{% endhighlight %}

Put your MySQL password, and then create a database, in this case I named it ```word``` with this command.
``` CREATE DATABASE word;```

thene click **Let’s go!** button.


you get the form bellow:

This page requires Database Name (the database you’ve created earlier). Username and Password of your MySQL.

![installation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/1/install.png)

Hit “Submit” button at the bottom and click “Run the installation” on the very next page.
![installation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/1/run.png)

Complete installation with admin information by Giving your site a title, username, password, and email address. Finally hit the “Install WordPress” button at the bottom.


![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/1/setup-new.png)

You have successfully installed WordPress on your computer. Log into your site now.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/1/log.png)

the admin panel :
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/1/admin-pa.png)


Congratulation your installation is done, If you encounter any problems with the installation, you can leave it in a comment.
